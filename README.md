## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates **end-to-end data analytics capabilities** using Microsoft Excel. Starting from raw, uncleaned data containing orders, products, and customer information, I have:

- **Cleansed and restructured** the dataset for analysis
- **Enriched the data** using advanced Excel functions
- **Created pivot tables** to answer key business questions
- **Designed an interactive dashboard** for sales performance visualization

The final output is a dynamic, user-friendly dashboard that enables stakeholders to make data-driven decisions about sales strategy, inventory management, and customer relationships.

## 📊 The Dataset

The original dataset consists of three interconnected tables:

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Orders** | Transaction records including order id, order date, customer id, product id and quantities |
| **Products** | Product catalog with coffee types, roast types, size, unit price and profit details |
| **Customers** | Customer contacts, demographics and loyalty card information |

These tables were consolidated and transformed to create a unified data model suitable for analysis.
